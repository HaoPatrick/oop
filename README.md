OOP Homework here
===

I push all the homework of this course to github now.

We are tought to understand the concept of object oriented programming using C++

I tried hard to use the latest features of C++, which refers to C++ 11, sometimes C++ 14&17.

Since C++ is too hard to master in such a short life, any issues and pull requests are welcomed.
