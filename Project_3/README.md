====

    * Monster Room
    * Princess Room
2. Maze - to generate a maze


Main Features
-----
1. Using C++ 11, only compiles and tested in C++
2. Using ` #pragma once ` instead of tradition ` #ifndef ` 
3. Using `std::random_device` to generate random numbers, however, this feature
only works in Linux environment. Explained in the [CPP reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/random_device/random_device).
> std::random_device may be implemented in terms of an implementation-defined pseudo-random number engine if a non-deterministic source (e.g. a hardware device) is not available to the implementation. In this case each std::random_device object may generate the same number sequence.
